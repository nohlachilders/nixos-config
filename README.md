# NixOS config
ignore this please and thank you :)
at time of writing this is under development and public for the purposes of easier testing on VMs. im trying to wrap my head around the language and layout of the OS currently. this is using misterio77s starter configs, and at time of writing doesnt deviate from them very much. if youre looking for configs id reccomend checking them out at https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs
